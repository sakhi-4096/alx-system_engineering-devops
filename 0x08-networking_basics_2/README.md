## Description
Networks and the internet form the backbone of modern communication. Networks provide the infrastructure for devices to connect and communicate within local environments (LANs) and across vast regions (WANs). At the same time, the internet interconnects these networks globally, creating a massive, interconnected web of information and services accessible to people around the world.
