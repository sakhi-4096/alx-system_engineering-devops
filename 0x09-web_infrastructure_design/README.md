# Web Infrastructure Design
The strategic planning and arrangement of various components that work together to deliver a web application or website to users.

## Description
Web infrastructure design outlines the architecture, components, and interactions necessary to ensure the seamless operation of an online platform. Web infrastructure design is a structured approach to creating a robust, performant, and scalable platform for delivering web applications. By carefully planning and arranging various components, businesses and developers ensure their online presence operates smoothly, delivering a reliable and engaging experience to users.

## Components
 * **Server(s):** The foundational hardware where all other components reside. Servers host web and application files, databases, and services.
 * **Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to optimize performance and ensure even load distribution.
 * **Web Server:** Handles HTTP requests from users' browsers, serves static files, and directs dynamic requests to the application server.
 * **Application Server:** Processes dynamic requests, executes business logic, and communicates with the database.
 * **Database:** Stores and manages structured data, providing reliable and efficient data storage and retrieval.
 * **Caching Services:** Stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce database load and improve response times.
 * **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Caches and distributes static assets (images, videos, stylesheets) across multiple geographically distributed servers to enhance content delivery speed.
 * **Security Infrastructure:** Includes firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection systems, and access controls to safeguard the platform against threats.
