## Description
 Web servers are a fundamental component of the internet and are responsible for delivering the web content you access in your web browser every day. They work in conjunction with web applications and databases to provide dynamic and interactive web experiences. It plays a central role in the World Wide Web, facilitating the exchange of data between web servers and web browsers or other clients. 

## Features
 * **HTTP Protocol:** Web servers primarily use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to communicate with web browsers and other clients. HTTP defines the rules and conventions for requesting and delivering web content.
 * **Request-Response Model:** Web servers operate on a request-response model. When a web browser or client sends an HTTP request to a web server, the server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response containing the requested data.
 * **Static and Dynamic Content:** Web servers can serve both static and dynamic content. Static content includes files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and videos. Dynamic content is generated on-the-fly by web applications, often using server-side scripting languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby.
 * **Port 80 (HTTP) and Port 443 (HTTPS):** Web servers typically listen on port 80 for HTTP traffic and port 443 for secure HTTP (HTTPS) traffic. HTTPS adds a layer of encryption and security, and it's used for transmitting sensitive data.
 * **Virtual Hosts:** Many web servers support virtual hosts, allowing multiple websites to be hosted on the same server with distinct domain names, IP addresses, or ports.
 * **Logging and Access Control:** Web servers often maintain access logs that record information about incoming requests. They also provide access control mechanisms to restrict access to certain resources.
