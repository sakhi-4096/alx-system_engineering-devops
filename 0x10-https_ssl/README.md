# HTTPS-SSL 
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of the HTTP protocol used for communication over the internet.

## Descriptioni
 It is designed to provide secure and encrypted data transfer between a user's web browser and a web server. The security in HTTPS is primarily achieved through the use of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols. HTTPS is crucial for protecting sensitive data, such as login credentials, financial transactions, and personal information, during online interactions. It has become the standard for secure web communication and is essential for building trust with website visitors. As a result, most modern websites and web applications use HTTPS to ensure the privacy and security of users' data.

## Features
 * **Encryption:** HTTPS encrypts the data exchanged between the user's browser and the web server. This encryption ensures that even if intercepted by a malicious entity, the data remains unreadable and confidential. SSL/TLS protocols are responsible for this encryption.
 * **Authentication:** SSL/TLS provides a mechanism for verifying the identity of the web server, assuring users that they are connecting to the legitimate website and not a fraudulent one. This is often represented by a padlock icon in the browser's address bar or a green address bar.
 * **Data Integrity:** HTTPS ensures that data remains intact and unaltered during transit. Any tampering or modification of the data can be detected, alerting the user to potential security threats.
 * **Certificates:** SSL/TLS certificates are issued by trusted third-party entities known as Certificate Authorities (CAs). These certificates contain the public key of the server and are used for encryption and authentication. Users' browsers come pre-installed with a list of trusted CAs.
 * **Handshake:** When a user's browser connects to a secure website (beginning with "https://"), an SSL/TLS handshake takes place. During this process, the server presents its digital certificate, and the client (browser) verifies the certificate's authenticity and establishes a secure connection.
 * **HTTPS Port:** Secure websites typically use port 443 for HTTPS communication. When a user accesses a secure website, their browser automatically uses port 443 for the connection.
 * **SSL/TLS Versions:** SSL and early versions of TLS (e.g., TLS 1.0) have been used in the past. However, due to security vulnerabilities, it is recommended to use modern TLS versions (e.g., TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3) for improved security.
 * **Mixed Content:** To maintain security, browsers may block mixed content, which is a combination of secure (HTTPS) and non-secure (HTTP) elements on a single web page. This can impact the proper functioning of a secure website.
