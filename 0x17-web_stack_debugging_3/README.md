## Description
The web stack typically includes several layers or components, and debugging may involve investigating issues at any of these layers.  It involves tracing the flow of data and code through the various components of the web stack to pinpoint the root cause of problems that affect the application's functionality, performance, or security. Web stack debugging can be a complex and time-consuming process, especially in distributed and microservices-based architectures. Effective debugging requires a systematic approach, collaboration among team members, and a good understanding of the web stack components and their interactions.

## Features
 * **Client-Side:** This includes the user's web browser and any client-side technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks. Debugging at this layer often involves issues related to the user interface, rendering, and interactivity.
 * **Web Server:** The web server, such as Nginx or Apache, is responsible for receiving incoming requests, routing them to the appropriate backend components, and serving web content. Debugging here can involve configuration issues, request handling, and load balancing.
 * **Application Server:** This layer runs the server-side code of the web application. It typically involves application frameworks (e.g., Ruby on Rails, Django, Node.js) and middleware (e.g., Express.js). Debugging may include issues related to business logic, data processing, and API endpoints.
 * **Database:** The database layer stores and manages data used by the web application. Debugging can include queries that are slow or incorrect, database schema issues, and data consistency problems.
 * **Networking:** Network-related issues can occur at various points in the web stack, including DNS resolution, firewalls, proxies, and content delivery networks (CDNs). Debugging here involves diagnosing connectivity problems and optimizing network performance.
 * **Security:** Security debugging focuses on identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and authentication issues.
